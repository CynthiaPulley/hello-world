# hello-world
A new repository for a new student
I love computers because there is no gray area.  If it's wrong it's because the programmer did something wrong or because the user did something wrong.  Computers only do what we ask and nothing else.  I have taken some coding classes, but always felt like it was over my head, but I know I love doing it...just want to understand why I am entering what I am entering.  Just learned today that in Syracuse this was available so I am checking it out.
